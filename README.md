# HouseHunting

Welcome to the ultimate house hunting game! Are you ready to explore different environments and hunt for sentient furniture to decorate your dream home with? In this first-person shooter game, you'll be heading out to various locations armed with a trusty weapon to take down tables, chairs, sofas, rugs, lamps, and more.

But be warned, these pieces of furniture are not your average decor. They're sentient, and they'll do everything they can to avoid being caught. You'll need to use your skills and strategy to set traps and track down your targets. The more precise your shots are, the better the quality of your furniture will be when you bring it back to your home.

As you start the game, you'll find yourself in a rustic cabin deep in the woods. The cabin serves as your home base, and it's where you'll be able to store all of the furniture you collect. You'll also find various upgrades and customization options here, allowing you to improve your weapon, craft new traps, and more.

The house hunting game is a unique and exciting experience that's perfect for fans of first-person shooters and interior decorating. With its immersive gameplay, stunning graphics, and challenging environments, you'll be hooked from the very start. So why wait? Grab your weapon and start hunting today!
